Web app to match up developers, with public pull requests (PRs) on Github, with
people willing to comment on their PRs.

The Basic Concept:

- Github users (coders) ask for someone to review a PR they have made.  The
  review-request goes into a list.

- Github users (reviewers) volunteer to review a PR.  They pick one from the
  list, "take" it, and it is removed from the list.

See the Issues for possible features saved for later, known bugs to fix, etc.

The code is currently deployed at http://www.PullRequestRoulette.com.
