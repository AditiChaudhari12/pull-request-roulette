pull-request-roulette
=====================

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/davearonson/pull-request-roulette.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/davearonson/pull-request-roulette)

Web app to match up developers, with public pull requests (PRs) on Github, with
people willing to comment on their PRs.

The Basic Concept:

- Github users (coders) ask for someone to review a PR they have made.  The
  review-request goes into a list.

- Github users (reviewers) volunteer to review a PR.  They pick one from the
  list, "take" it, and it is removed from the list.

See the Issues for possible features saved for later, known bugs to fix, etc.
